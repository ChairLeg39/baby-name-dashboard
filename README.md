# baby-name-dashboard

This repository was created to host additional visualizations for the `baby-name-project-4` on GitHub Pages. 

## Purpose

This repository hosts an independent HTML and JavaScript project that complements the primary `baby-name-project-4` repository. By deploying this project on GitHub Pages, users can easily access additional visualizations through a link provided on the main projectâ€™s landing page.

## GitHub Pages

The contents of this repository are published on GitHub Pages, allowing users to view the additional visualizations directly in their browser. The link from the main project redirects to this hosted page, ensuring seamless integration between the two parts of the project.
